Project Proposal
Project Title: Design and Development of a Web-Based Automated Timetable Scheduling System.
1.	Summary
Course timetabling is a major administrative task in tertiary institutions. In many faculties, the current method is manually, relying on spreadsheets, handwritten drafts, and trial-and-error adjustments. This manual process often results in significant errors such as:
•	Clashing of courses for students.
•	Lecturers scheduled to teach more than one class at the same time.
•	Venue conflicts (two courses assigned to the same room).
•	Human fatigue and delays in preparing the timetable.
These problems affect academic organization, cause inefficiency, and lead to confusion among students and lecturers.
This project proposes the development of a web-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) application that automates the entire timetable generation process for a faculty.
When course details, lecturers, venues, and available time slots are uploaded, the system automatically generates a conflict-free timetable.
2.	Objective
The objectives of this project are to:
1.	Design a user-friendly web interface for uploading course, lecturer, and venue information.
2.	Develop a backend scheduling engine that automatically allocates courses to appropriate time slots and venues.
3.	Ensure the system detects and prevents timetable conflicts such as:
•	Course clashes
•	Lecturer double-booking
•	Venue overlap
4.	Enable administrators to modify entries and regenerate the timetable without starting from scratch.
5.	Provide downloadable or printable versions of the generated timetable.
6.	Deploy the system as a SaaS-style web application accessible within the faculty network.
3. Tools and Technologies
	Frontend
•	HTML, CSS, JavaScript
•	React.js 
Backend:
•	Python (Flask or Django)
•	Scheduling algorithm (e.g., Constraint Satisfaction, Rule-Based Scheduling)
Database:
•	MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQLite
4. Methodology
•	Collect timetable requirements (courses, lecturers, venues, constraints).
•	Build database structures to store these inputs.
•	Implement a scheduling engine that assigns time slots        automatically.
•	Build an interface for admin to upload/update data.
•	Generate timetable as a table view.
•	Allow printing/downloading as PDF.
•	Test with real faculty data.
5. Expected outcome
		The system will:
•	Eliminate human errors in timetable creation.
•	Save administrative time and effort.
•	Improve accuracy of scheduling.
•	Enhance organization within the faculty.
•	Provide a digital, reusable platform for yearly timetable generation.
•	Serve as a foundation for university-wide automation in the future.
